#+TITLE:  Workshop for Emacs Macros
#+AUTHOR: Howard Abrams
#+DATE:   2015 Nov 24
#+TAGS:   emacs workshop
#+STARTUP: hideblocks

Basic idea of this file is to be both a *guide* and a *practice pad*
for leveling up on Emacs’ keyboard macro system.

To use, just [[https://github.com/howardabrams/pdx-emacs-hackers/raw/master/workshops/keyboard-macros.org][download this file]] to your system, and edit it in Emacs.
Then just follow along... If you are not familiar with org-mode files,
here are the basics for this workshop:

  - Hit a tab on the header expands or collapses it
  - Narrow to show just one section with: C-x n s
  - Return by widening normally with: C-x n w
  - Hyperlinks can be clicked on to view the Emacs Manual

Pretty much treat the rest of this document as a text file.

* Basic Usage

  Let’s begin with something simple to try out this project.
  In the /block area/ below, hit: C-c ' (yes, the apostrophe).
  When done with the tasks, hit: C-x C-s to close and return here.

  #+BEGIN_SRC org

  #+END_SRC

  Notice that the frame is split with this document still visible?

  Good, let’s play around. Let’s capitalize the first letter of each line.
  Position point at the beginning of the first line, and then:

  - F3
  - M-c
  - C-n
  - C-a
  - F4

  Press F4 repeatedly to capitalize the first word on each line.
  Don’t capitalize /every/ line... leave a few alone for a moment.
  Now you have the basics.

  Let’s make a new macro to capitalize the /last/ word on each line.
  Pop back up to the top of the list, and:

  - F3
  - C-e
  - M-b
  - M-c
  - C-n
  - F4

  Once again, leave a few lines alone.
  Just one more macro, as I want to show you something interesting.
  Jump back to the beginning, and:

  - F3
  - C-a
  - M-f
  - Space
  - foobar (or type any single word you find amusing)
  - C-n
  - F4

  Type: C-x C-k C-k

  Notice it behaves the same as F4, but you can keep typing C-k to
  execute your macro.

  Start typing C-n and/or C-p and notice the minibuffer. It alternates
  between the following:

  - M-c C-n C-a
  - C-e M-b M-c C-n
  - C-a M-f SPC f 2*o b a r C-n

  Typing C-k at any point will execute that macro. You’ve now see the
  Emacs Macro Ring, and can manipulate it. You are now at Level 2.

  Type C-c ' (apostrophe) to close that side window.

* Naming Macros

  While that =foobar= macro may be quite handy, looping around the
  keyboard macro ring to select it may be inefficient. Name it!

     C-x C-k n

  Give it a name of foobar, and now, you can: M-x foobar
  to have the macro run.

  Perhaps it may be more useful to bind that macro to some un-used
  key, like C-c k or F2 ... type:

     C-x C-k b

  And then type your binding, e.g. C-c k

  You know that C-c followed by a single letter is supposed to be free
  of usage and available for your nefarious reasons, right?

  Read the [[info:emacs#Save%20Keyboard%20Macro][the Emacs Manual]] for details. If you actually tried this
  example, then you have earned enough experience points to be level 3.

* What do you mean On Every Line?

  Keyboard macros are slick, and while we /could/ prefix the F4 with
  the numbering prefix to run it multiple times at once, e.g. C-9 F4,
  a typical use case is to run it on every line in a region.

  Position the cursor in the block, and type: C-c ‘

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    I will take out the trash
    I should stop swearing
    I may stop to smell the roses
    I do want to go shopping
    I could care less
  #+END_SRC

  With the point on the first line, type:

  - F3
  - C-a
  - M-f
  - M-f
  - Space
  - not (type the word, =not=)
  - F4

  Now select the remaining 4 lines any way you like, and type:

  - C-x C-k r

  Read [[info:emacs#Basic%20Keyboard%20Macro][the Emacs Manual]] for complete details, and welcome to level 4.

* Numbering

  Numbering things seems to be important to people. Let’s see if we
  can easily number the worst song ever inflicted on humanity.

  Once again, position the point inside the block, and type: C-c '

  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    Drummers Drumming
    Pipers Piping
    Lords a Leaping
    Ladies Dancing
    Maids a Milking
    Swans a Swimming
    Geese a Laying
    Golden Rings
    Calling Birds
    French Hens
    Turtle Doves
    Partridge in a Pear Tree
  #+END_SRC

  Follow along at home. First, position the point at the end (on the
  line with the partridge), and:

  - C-x C-k C-c
  - 1
  - Return (to set a counter to 1)
  - F3
  - C-a
  - F3
  - Spacebar
  - C-n
  - F4

  Yes, hitting the F3 key twice (once to start the macro, and again to
  insert the value of the counter) is a bit odd. You can also use the
  binding: C-x C-k C-i

  Each time you hit F4, you increment the counter that is inserted.

  By the way, if you didn’t do the whole =C-x C-k C-c= to set the
  counter to 1, the first value would be 0.  Read [[info:emacs#Keyboard%20Macro%20Counter][the manual]] for
  details.

* Fixing Macros

  Now that you are a Level 5 Elf Keyboard Macro-er, and you can now
  sling macros everywhere, you may notice that sometimes, in the
  middle of a long macro, you flub it.

  If you hit F4 too soon (it happens), hit: C-u C-u F3 to pick up
  where you left off and enter the rest of the macro. Hit F4 when you
  are really finished.

  If you need to fix a keyboard macro with more finesse, type:

      C-x C-k C-e

  And behold the glory. Tis a simple language that should be pretty
  obvious to a skilled Macro-er as yourself. Type C-h m once in that
  buffer to display details of how to edit the macro.  When you are
  finished editing, type: C-c C-c

  I’ll let you play around with your own example for this one.
  Read [[info:emacs#Edit%20Keyboard%20Macro][the manual]] for complete details.

* Variations on a Theme

  To gain the Level 7 Keyboard Macro-er title, one should know how to
  customize a macro /while/ running it. The following section of HTML
  code needs some textual changes. We want to add one of the following
  phrases to the /end/ of every paragraph that has a =class= of =change=:

  * Because I said so. Got it?
  * Because I'm the boss. Got it?
  * You heard me. Got it?
  * Just do it. Got it?

  To begin, first move to the following block (hint: C-c M-f) and hit
  TAB to collapse the block (you gotta see all the instructions,
  right?)  Next, issue a C-c ' on this block to show it in a new
  window. If you have trouble with your HTML mode, change the =html=
  to =text=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <body>
        <p>
          Proin neque massa, cursus ut, gravida ut, lobortis eget, lacus.
          Praesent augue.  Sed diam.  Nunc eleifend leo vitae magna.  Nunc
          rutrum turpis sed pede.
        </p>
        <p class="change">
          Nullam rutrum.  Nunc rutrum turpis sed pede.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phasellus at dui in ligula mollis ultricies.  Curabitur lacinia
          pulvinar nibh.  Donec pretium posuere tellus.  Praesent
          fermentum tempor tellus.  Proin quam nisl, tincidunt et, mattis
          eget, convallis nec, purus.
        </p>
        <p class="change">
          Fusce sagittis, libero non molestie mollis, magna orci ultrices
          dolor, at vulputate neque nulla lacinia eros.  Sed diam.  Nam
          vestibulum accumsan nisl.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aliquam feugiat tellus ut neque. Nam vestibulum accumsan
          nisl. Praesent fermentum tempor tellus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vivamus id enim.  Suspendisse potenti.  Curabitur lacinia
          pulvinar nibh.  Mauris ac felis vel velit tristique imperdiet.
        </p>
        <p class="change">
          Donec vitae dolor.  Mauris ac felis vel velit tristique
          imperdiet.  Nunc aliquet, augue nec adipiscing interdum, lacus
          tellus malesuada massa, quis varius mi purus non odio.  Proin
          quam nisl, tincidunt et, mattis eget, convallis nec, purus.  Nam
          euismod tellus id erat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nullam rutrum.
        </p>
      </body>
    </html>
  #+END_SRC

  Type the following:

  - F3
  - C-s
  - Type: class="change"
  - C-e
  - C-s
  - Type: </p>
  - C-p
  - C-e
  - C-x q
  - Type: Got it?
  - C-n
  - F4

  In this particular case, we actually didn't do anything special, so
  move to the beginning of the buffer, and hit F4, and the cursor will
  go to the end of every paragraph that needs changing, and stop with
  a prompt:

  Proceed with macro? (Y, N, RET, C-l, C-r)

  Type C-r and begin typing one of our phrases, and when you are done,
  type: C-M-c

  The prompt will be re-displayed, so finish the macro with 'Y'.
  Check out [[info:emacs#Keyboard%20Macro%20Query][the manual]] for details on this =C-x q= business.
